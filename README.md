# Progetto SWENG A.A. 2022/23
Gruppo: Alessio Arcara, Alessia Crimaldi, Davide Fermi, Matteo Sacco

## Quick Start Guide

To successfully launch, test, and use the application, it is important to follow some simple steps:

* Have the Java 11 or higher SDK installed
* Clone repository from GitHub at URL: https://github.com/alessioarcara/project_sweng.git
* Open a terminal in the root folder of the downloaded source code and then run the following commands:
`mvn clean` to clean up any previous program compilations
`mvn package` to create the program build and run it
`mvn gwt:devmode` to run the program in development mode

At this point, "Jetty" will open, a control window of the GWT execution environment, which will allow you to start the application through the "Launch Default Browser" button. Once this is done, you can use any browser to open the application page at the address "127.0.0.1:8888" (this operation is usually automatically performed by Jetty when you click the "Launch Default Browser" button).
